body
	Not all commits are complex enough to warrant a body, therefore it is optional and only 
	used when a commit requires a bit of explanation and context. Use the body to explain the
	what and why of a commit, not the how.When writing a body, the blank line between the title
	and the body is required and you should limit the length of each line to no more than 72 characters
foot
	The footer is optional and is used to reference issue tracker IDs
	If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
	like this:
